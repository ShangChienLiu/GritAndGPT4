Stay alert and maintain a safe distance from the cars on the road, especially the yellow car ahead. Keep an eye on traffic signs, such as the blue street sign on your right. Pay attention to road markings like the white arrow, indicating lane directions. Also, be cautious while driving near parked cars and always watch for pedestrians near sidewalks.
