Keep an eye on the silver minivan and green bus in the street, as well as the man on a black motorcycle. Also, pay attention to traffic signs including the round blue sign with white arrows and red and white sign. Drive cautiously around other cars on the street, and be aware of your surroundings such as buildings, flags, and pedestrians.
