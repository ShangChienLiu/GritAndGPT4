Keep an eye on the traffic around you, especially the cars parked on the street and those driving nearby. Pay attention to the green light ahead, and be cautious of pedestrians who may walk out from behind parked vehicles or buildings. Also, don't forget to watch for any orange cones indicating potential road work or hazards.
