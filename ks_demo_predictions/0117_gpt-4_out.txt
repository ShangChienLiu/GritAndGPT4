Keep an eye on the white van and the white truck on the road. Be cautious of multiple motorcycles and scooters around you. Pay attention to double yellow lines on the road, as they indicate no passing or crossing over to another lane. Also, stay aware of pedestrians who may be near signs and buildings along the city street.
